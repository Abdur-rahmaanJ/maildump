# MailDump

MailDump is a python-based clone of the awesome [MailCatcher][mailcatcher] tool.
Its purpose is to provide developers a way to let applications send emails without actual emails being sent to anyone.
Additionally lazy developers might prefer this over a real SMTP server simply for the sake of it being much easier and
faster to set up.

## Features

Since the goal of this project is to have the same features as MailCatcher I suggest you to read its readme instead.

## Warning

This is still very much WIP and thus not in a usable state yet. If you install it don't complain that there is no
working web interface yet. Receiving emails and the REST API works though. Oh, and even when omitting the `-f` switch
the process stays in foreground.

## Credits

The layout of the web interface has been taken from MailCatcher. No Copy&Paste involved - I rewrote the SASS/Compass
stylesheet from MailCatcher in SCSS as there is a pure-python implementation of SCSS available.
If whoever reads this feels like creating a new layout that looks as good or even better feel free to send a pull
request. I'd actually prefer a layout that differs from MailCatcher at least a little bit but I'm somewhat bad at
creating layouts!
